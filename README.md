# hello-world
Just getting my feet wet before the coding-life plunge!

Hello, Terrans!

I have ventured to this soggy orb to develop my developer skills with your coding ninjas. I come in peace with cookies and milk. 
These changes herein are made for no other reason than to mark the beginning of my coding odyssey. 

See you all in the intertubes!
